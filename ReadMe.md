# Usage

Open the webpage, click on either "Insult", "Biting Remark", or "Clever Comeback" to start the game. With every turn the player takes, the computer gets a turn to do damage as well. The computer does NOT have a heal option while the player does. The player also has an extra life option (which the computer does not) as indicated my the little number next to the user's reputation. 
Keep pressing one of the three buttons to continue playing the game, once either the computers or user's reputation bar is completely depleted, the other person wins. 
The computer's turn comes automatically after the players turn.

# Note

The code can be refactored and some more features could be added. I am planning on re-doing this project in React in the near future.

# Interesting Tidbit
An interesting Regency era tidbit: Pineapples were very exotic and so expensive that hostesses used them as centerpieces on their dinner tables to show their wealth. They were hardly ever eaten as they were too precious and were often passed from hostess to hostess to use as decoration until they rotted.
